    "# Q1. Social Platform Member Manager [10 points]\n",
    "\n",
    "In many modern social platforms (such as Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook), users can choose to follow one another. Your task is to design a class named `Member` that represents an individual on such a platform. The class should support the following functionalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unique Username\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each `Member` must have a username that is unique, ignoring case differences (i.e., 'Alice' and 'alice' are considered the same).\n",
    "- If an attempt is made to create a new member with a username that already exists, output an error message to the standard error stream (`stderr`) and mark the member as invalid rather than completing its creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tracking Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "Each valid `Member` should be able to keep track of:\n",
    "- The set of other members they are following.\n",
    "- The set of other members who follow them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods to Implement\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Follow another member:**  \n",
    "   Provide a method to allow one member to follow another, but only if both members are valid.\n",
    "2. **Unfollow a member:**  \n",
    "   Provide a method to allow one member to stop following another.\n",
    "3. **List Following:**  \n",
    "   Provide a method that returns a list of usernames that this member is following, sorted alphabetically.\n",
    "4. **List Followers:**  \n",
    "   Provide a method that returns a list of usernames of the members that follow this member, also sorted alphabetically.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Helper Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the following helper functions as **class methods** to manage member states:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `clear_existing_members`: Clears all valid members from the class-level storage.\n",
    "- `clear_invalid_members`: Clears all invalid members from the class-level storage."
